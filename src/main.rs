// ENTRY POINT
// GOAL:
// Acts as the entry point for the OS, this setup all the
// basic rules, requirements, and modules that will allow the OS to be freestanding,
// working and bootable.


// Binary needs to be freestanding (runs without underlying OS),
// stdlib have dependency to OS, so we disable it
#![no_std]
// Freestanding binary have no access to rust's runtime and crt0.
// crt0 is the entry point for rust programs. no_main override the
// entry point, so crt0 and rust's runtime doesn't get called.
// "default entry point (crt0 -> rust runtime -> main)"
#![no_main]

// we make this function to serve as our program entry point.
//
// no_mangle used to prevent name from being mangled during compilation
// extern "C" tells the compiler to use C calling convention for this function.
// Return type is never (`!`) aka never returns, because this function is
// called by the bootloader directly so doesn't need to return normally. It calls exit to stop.
